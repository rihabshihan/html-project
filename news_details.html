<h1>UAE Removed from FATF Grey List, Despite Evidence of Role in Illicit Arms and Gold Trade</h1>

<p><strong>Anrike Visser, Senior Advisor on Illicit Finance Policy to The Sentry,</strong> said: “Today the Financial Action Task Force fully welcomes the UAE back into the international financial system and removes the need for enhanced scrutiny on transactions stemming from the Emirates. At the same time, evidence indicates the ongoing role of the UAE in facilitating the illicit arms and gold trade fuelling the war in Sudan.</p>

<p>Only a month ago, a United Nations Panel of Experts report was leaked citing “credible” evidence the UAE was supplying arms to the warring parties in Sudan, despite a 2005 UN arms embargo. It details how gold linked to the Rapid Support Forces, accused of committing war crimes in Sudan together with the Sudanese Armed Forces, has continued to flow to Dubai, even since the war broke out. Half of the gold mined in Sudan is smuggled out of the country. The report clearly shows a Dubai-based financial advisor and former official of the Sudanese Central Bank helping manage the RSF’s international network of proxy companies.</p>
