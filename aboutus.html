			<p><strong>WHAT DOES TIMES OF INDIA DO ?</strong></p>

	<p>The Times of India, also known by its abbreviation TOI, is an Indian English-language daily newspaper and digital news media owned and managed by The Times Group. It is the fourth-largest newspaper in India by circulation and largest selling English-language daily in the world.</p>

	<p> It is the oldest English-language newspaper in India, and the second-oldest Indian newspaper still in circulation, with its first edition published in 1838.[7] It is nicknamed as "The Old Lady of Bori Bunder",[8][9] and is an Indian "newspaper of record".[10][11]

 	<p>Near the beginning of the 20th century, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, called TOI "the leading paper in Asia".[12][13] In 1991, the BBC ranked TOI among the world's six best newspapers.[14][15]</p>

	<p>It is owned and published by Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. (B.C.C.L.), which is owned by the Sahu Jain family. In the Brand Trust Report India study 2019, TOI was rated as the most trusted English newspaper in India.[16] In a 2021 survey, Reuters Institute rated TOI as the most trusted media news brand among English-speaking, online news users in India.[17] In recent decades, the newspaper has been criticised for establishing in the Indian news industry the practice of accepting payments from persons and entities in exchange for positive coverage.[5]</p>

			<p> <strong> HISTORY OF TIMES OF INDIA</strong></p>

	<p>TOI issued its first edition on 3 November 1838 as The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce.[18][19] The paper was published on Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar, a Maharashtrian social reformer, and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the Indian Subcontinent. J. E. Brennan was its first editor he died in 1839 and George Buist became the Editor. It became a daily in 1850 under him.</p>

	<p>George Buist had a pro British editorial policy and a Parsi shareholder Fardoonji Naoroji wanted him to change his editorial policy particularly in background of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, Buist refused to change his editorial policy or give up his editorial independence. After a shareholder's meeting he was replaced by Robert Knight.[20][21][22][23]</p>

	<p>In 1860, editor Robert Knight (1825â€“1892) bought the Indian shareholders' interests, merged with rival Bombay Standard, and started India's first news agency. It wired Times dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for Reuters news service. In 1861, he changed the name from the Bombay Times and Standard to The Times of India. Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation, frequently resisting the attempts by governments, business interests and cultural spokesmen, and led the paper to national prominence.[24][25] In the 19th century, this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in India and Europe.</p>
